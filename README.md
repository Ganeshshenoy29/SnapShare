This File Sharing Application is a full-stack web project built using Node.js, Express, and Multer that allows users to upload files and generate secure, shareable download links instantly. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can select a file, upload it to the server, and receive a unique URL that can be used to download the file later through a dedicated download page.On the backend, Express handles routing and API logic, while Multer manages file uploads and storage. The project demonstrates essential backend development concepts such as handling multipart form data, serving static files, dynamic URL generation, and proper error handling. Uploaded files are stored on the server, and download requests are processed through controlled routes instead of direct file access.
The frontend is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, keeping the focus on core web fundamentals without relying on heavy frameworks. This makes the project easy to understand and extend for beginners while still being practical and real-world ready.The application is deployed on Render, showcasing cloud deployment skills and environment-based configuration. Overall, this project serves as a solid example of building, deploying, and maintaining a functional file-sharing system using modern web technologies.
